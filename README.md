## Restaurant Name and Food Menu Generator

This project is a Restaurant Name and Food Menu Generator that uses the Gemini-1.5-pro language model and API. It takes a cuisine type as input and leverages the power of LLMs to generate creative restaurant names and corresponding food menu items. The application is built using Lang Chain for seamless integration with the Gemini model, and Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface. This tool can assist entrepreneurs, food enthusiasts, or game developers in quickly generating themed restaurant concepts and menus.
